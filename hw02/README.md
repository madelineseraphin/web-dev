2. Click any function key to select an operator
3. Before typing in another number you can change which operator you want by clicking a different function key
4. Click any number keys to type in a second number
5. Click the equals key or another function key to see the answer
6. If you then click another number key, it will use that answer as the first number, the highlighted function key as the operator, and the number you are now inputting as the second number
